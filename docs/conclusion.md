# Conclusion
We have come to the end of KotlinToDo! :tada:

There are still many things that can be improved about and added to the application, however, it is currently a functioning prototype.

I hope that you have managed to learn something from this talk and are interested in Kotlin.

## Further Reading
If you have taken an interest in Kotlin, these are several resources that you can use to learn about more about it and see how it is being used:

* **Kotlin documentations**
  
  The documentations for Kotlin is immaculate and thorough, and it will carry you from being a novice at Kotlin to using Kotlin for your future projects in Android.

  You can find the documentation [here.](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/)

* **HotBot**
  
  This project is started by the owner of one of the Discord servers I'm on and it is a very large community driven project that boasts a lot of the strengths of Kotlin.

  It is a Discord bot and you can create your own copy by following these [instructions.](https://gitlab.com/Aberrantfox/hotbot/blob/master/Installation.md)

  You can find the repository [here](https://gitlab.com/Aberrantfox/hotbot)

* **Taiga**
  
  As a shameless plug, Taiga is a Discord bot written in Kotlin by me. It is aimed at multi-server management and whilst the code might not be as pristine as that of HotBot, I have included a thorough usage guide and developer guide [here.](https://woojiahao.github.io/Taiga)

  You can invite her to your server to test out her set of commands.

  I am also actively looking for contributors for the project to iron out a couple of bugs.

  You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/woojiahao/Taiga)

* **Exposed framework**
  
  This is a database ORM written in Kotlin that makes heavy use of lambdas in Kotlin to enable developers to access and use a database without needing to write a word of SQL. I highly recommend trying it out if your project is interfacing with a database as it really eases your burden.

  You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed)

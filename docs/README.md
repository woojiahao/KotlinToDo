**Note:** This tutorial will not be an exhaustive introduction to Kotlin, Kotlin is a gargantuan language and covering all of its features in a couple of hours is simply not possible. This is simply meant to show the capabilities of Kotlin and why it should be used for Android development. 

## Following Along
If you are following along with the tutorial, it is best to go through the [set up](setup.md) instructions for Android Studio before the talk in order to reduce the amount of time spent setting up everything.

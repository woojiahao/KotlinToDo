**Note:** This tutorial will not be an exhaustive introduction to Kotlin, Kotlin is a gargantuan 
language and covering all of its features in a couple of hours is simply not possible. This is 
simply meant to show the capabilities of Kotlin and why it should be used for Android development. 

## Brief
If you are following along with the tutorial, it is best to go through the [set up](setup.md) 
instructions for Android Studio before the talk in order to reduce the amount of time spent setting 
up everything.

The talk will be split into 3 sections:

* **Kotlin basics** - introducing the basics of Kotlin as well as the history of it
* **Building the application** - begin with building the application
* **Enhancing the program** - enhance the existing code base using Kotlin's advanced features

The slides used for the talk can be found [here.](https://github.com/woojiahao/KotlinToDo/blob/master/docs/Slides.pptx)
